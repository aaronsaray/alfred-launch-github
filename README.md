Launch Github
---

This is an Alfred Workflow to launch Github pages based on your repo access.

It will ask you to configure when you first install it.

This is a 'beta' release currently. PR's welcome.

## Usage

`gh <repo search term>` searches your cached repos

`gh-sync` re-syncs the data in - like if you got new access to things
